# Bank Management System

## Project Overview

This **Bank Management System** is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate banking operations for both users and staff. It allows users to manage their personal banking accounts, perform transactions, and securely handle their finances, while staff members can oversee account details and manage user data. Built using **Java**, **JDBC**, and **MySQL**, this system ensures smooth and efficient interaction between users and banking services.

## Features

### User Registration and Account Management:
- **User Registration**: Users can create a new bank account by providing personal information such as name, gender, age, phone number, address, and passwords (login and transaction).
- **12-Digit Bank Card Number**: Automatically generated and assigned upon account creation.
- **Account Management**: Users can update personal details and manage their banking information with ease.

### User Functionalities:
- **View Account Information**: Check account balance and detailed account information.
- **Deposit**: Add funds to the user's bank account.
- **Withdraw**: Securely withdraw funds with transaction password verification.
- **Transfer**: Transfer funds to other user accounts after verifying the transaction password.
- **Password Update**: Change login and transaction passwords for enhanced security.
- **Account Closure**: Users can choose to close their account, which will remove all associated data.

### Staff Functionalities:
- **View Transaction Records**: Access transaction logs, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers across all accounts.
- **Account Status Inquiry**: Review account balances and current status (Active/Closed) of all users.
- **Modify User Information**: Edit user details such as name, gender, age, phone number, and address.

## Database Structure

- **Users Table (`users`)**: Stores personal information, including name, gender, age, phone number, address, passwords, and transaction passwords.
- **Accounts Table (`accounts`)**: Contains details about user bank accounts, such as account balance and bank card number.
- **Transactions Table (`transactions`)**: Logs all transaction activities, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Deposit/Withdrawal/Transfer Records**: Separate tables to store detailed logs for each transaction type.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used for developing the system.
- **JDBC**: For connecting the system with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing user and transaction data.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the MySQL database with the provided schema.
3. Ensure JDBC connectivity is correctly configured.
4. Run the Java application using your preferred IDE or command line.
